* Node.js core apis are built around **idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture**.

what are the events in Node.js  ?
* Node.js follows event-driven architecture. where actions (event) (emitters) triggers specific function object (listeners).
* The eventEmitter class in the events  module is used to handel events. (emit event) are instance of  evenEmitter class.
* Events in Node.js work  like a publisher-subscriber model,where an event is emitted and event listener response.

Why use events ?
* Helps in async programming without called back hell.
* Mostly used in real time  application  like chat, gaming.
* core modules in node.js use events internally. like fs,http.

Node.js is event-driven because its core architecture is designed to efficiently handle multiple tasks at once by reacting to events (such as incoming HTTP requests, file I/O completions, or timers) instead of following a traditional, sequential execution flow. This model allows Node.js to maximize scalability, responsiveness, and resource efficiency, especially for I/O-bound and real-time applications.

The event-driven architecture in Node.js relies on several key concepts:

Events: Signals that something of interest has happened, like receiving data or a user action.

Event Emitters: Objects in Node.js that emit events; many core modules, such as HTTP servers and streams, are event emitters.

Listeners/Callbacks: Functions attached to events and executed when the events are emitted.

Event Loop: The mechanism that watches for events and invokes the registered callbacks without blocking other operations.

What are Buffers in Node.js?
* A buffer is a temporary storage area for binary data.
* Node.js does not support direct binary manipulation (like c/c++) so buffers help handle raw data efficiently.
* Used mostly when dealing with file streams, network data, and binary protocols.

Why Do we Need Buffers?
* JavaScript are UTF-16 encoded, making direct binary data handling inefficient.
* Buffer store binary data outside v8's heap.
* Useful When working with:
    * File system.
    * Networking (TCP, UDP, Web-Scoket)
    * Streams (handling chunks of data).
