### What is Middleware in Express.js?
In Express.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects, as well as a next() function to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

### What is .use()?
The method express.use() (or app.use()) is the main way to add middleware functions to your Express app. This method allows you to bind middleware to your entire application or to a specific route or group of routes.

* Middlewares are two types.
    * Global middlewares - (Top level).
    * Route Middleware - (any runs for a particular route).
